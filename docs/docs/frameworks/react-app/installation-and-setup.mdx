description: Quick and up to speed setup with celo composer for react developers.
---

Getting started with celo composer is now easier than ever and less confusing than before, especially for new developers.
Thanks to the folks on the Celo deverel team for making a major update that allows you setup celo composer by running a command and only choosing what package you need for your development.

In this guide we will be setting up a celo composer project for using the React Nextjs package for our frontend and hardhat package for writing our smart contracts. We won't be including the graph package and as a choice of smart contract development environment we will be using **Hardhart** and not **Truffle**.

### Step 1

Install the celo composer package gollably on your machine by running

```
npm i @celo/celo-composer -g
```

After you have successfully done so, now its time to create a new project. Run below command and you will be prompted with the Celo Composer CLI

```
npx celo-composer create
```

Choose the first option, that shows **React (with examples ...)**

Next, choose smart contract for the smart contract framework.

We wont be need subgraph so we choose **No**.

Finally, enter the name of your project where the installation file will be, for this purpose I choose to use **celo-composer-getting-started**. I will assume in your case it will be the name of the project you are working on e.g _celo-swap-project_

When the installation is completed it will show you **ðŸ’¯ Done!**.

If you open your new Celo Composer project in your favourite editor, your directory structure should look like below. I am currently use Celo Composer version _1.0.1_, so there might be some diffrence in the future if you are using a later version.
